<h1>The Future World</h1>
<p>Our world got some couple changes and will get another changes that will improve the way were living forever.In this report we will illustrate 
some of the expected future changes that could happen.<p>
<br>
<br>
And those are the points that we are going to talk about
<ol>
<li>future cras</li>
<li>future houses</li>
<li>how the society might be</li>
<li>future teaching</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h1>1.Future cars</h1>
<p>Cars in the future will definitely be way more difrent than what we are in now some of them 
actually began changing now like electric cars which are created by the billionare elon musk
which created tesla cars company which works from electrically by energy instead of fuel,and 
they are auto driving cars which will decrease the car accidents and increase the saftey of 
the trafic,and also ensures that the driver is cofortable.<p>
<p>Another view of the future cars,there are some expectations that the cars could hover above our heads and actually work by electrics power to 
but that should be at the higher degree of saftey because one eror in the car could cause definet death and could cause lots of injuries for another
peoples.But still this idea could be formed in the far future and with far more degrees of saftey.<p>
 <br>
 
<h1>2.Future houses</h1>
unfortunatly house will change either you wanted or no,but here we will list some of the changes that that will happen nearly in the future.
<p>firstly,houses top will change into a solar board that will coduct the energy and will send it to the main power control and will allow 
us to use this energy in everything in our house and will definitly save our money<b>(this product was intriduced by"<i>Elon Musk</i>")</b></p>
<br>
<p>secondly, house will definetly be enhanced with tecknological item which might be ocupied with ai soud system thta could talk to u natularly and 
run out what evre you order,for examplpe:it might cook for you or prepeare a cofe for you or anything thats posible to be doneand might set up an 
alarm just by hearing you order that.</p>
<br>
 <p>thirdly,houses could be self cleaning by ordering it by the sound system that we talked about,after ordering it the house will automaticly clean
 it self with high quality of cleanes.</p>
<br>
<h1>3.How Society Might Be</h1>
 Our society might change so much either from the technological side or the way we are living or the place we wil live in,and thats all duo to <b>Elon Musk</b>
 <p><b>Elon Musk</b> is now creating a rocket called <b><i>Big Falcon Rocket</b></i> this rocket will hopefully be able to send our generations to the 
 planet mars,after sending the first human there we will start colonizing mars,After that we will try sending more humans over there to the be filled
 with humans and be a living place</p>
<p> In another way our society might be filled with robots that are doing most of the jobs instead of humans and that will decrease the <ins>slavery</ins>
 rate all around the world and help the world be a more united place,plus robots will work 24 hours without a break and also without a salary and 
 also will work with more efficiency and injuries and mistakes will deacrease 95% than what it was when these jobs were made by simple humans. </p>
 <h1>4.Future teaching</h1>
 <p>Teaching will change surely to the better by which better learning enviroment will be given for the kids learning,also more teaching tools will be 
 avilable for the kids or whoever learning,also if teaching is going to be also done by <ins>AI</INS> tecknology the human made mistakes in teaching will 
 definetly deacrease and and and the information given to the student will be much more confirmed.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 And this is how the near might future might be.Hope you enjoyed
